Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 
Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process of used to design, develop, test, and maintain software applications. It is a methodology that defines the entire procedures of software development step-by-step, ensuring high-quality, maintainable software that meets users requirements.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Planning and requirement analysis: This involves gathering all relevant information from stakeholders, analyzing it and determing what is feasible. 
2. Designing: This involves creating a design specification that answers the question "How will we build this?". this includes determing the priority order of the proposed work, building a product roadmapan and obtaining a stakeholder agreements on it.
3. Implement or Code: This involves translating the high-level overview into a tactical set of assignments, due dates and day-to-day work schedules, where the engineering team codes the product.
4. Test: This involves releasing the software product to a testing environment, where the quality assurance team and developers test all areas of the application to spot any defects, bugs or other problems.
5. Deploy: This phase involves the releasing of the software to the production environment, making it generally available for customers to buy and use.
6. Maintain: Thia phase involves addressing requests for enhancements, bug fixes, and new features, ensuring the software remains functional and meets evolving user needs. 
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: These are two prominent methodologies used in software development and project manangement. 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is particularly well-suited for projects with changing requirements and uncertainty.
Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach that relies on meticulous planning and execution of project phases one after the other. It is well-suited for projects with well-defined requirements and a predictable timeline. 
Key Differences are:
1. Agile is flexible, collaborative, promotes customer satisfaction, iterates development and suitable for risk management.
